circadian clocks using differential equations. Whilst I don't have experience with Matlab, I do have experience with Python, so this review will contrast the two languages.\nJulia, at the present times, appears relative destined to fall behind Python as far as popularity goes. I believe that Julia requires knowing more programming theory, or at least, less common programming theory. Writing Julia utilizes the type system to a much greater extent than python, has a type system unlike any other language I've seen, introducing a concept of \"type stability\". Julia variables are typed, but they are inferred, and are generally re-assignable to a new type without errors, making transferring from python slightly simpler. \nProgrammatic Theory\nJulia is not object orientated. It has structs, generics, and the concept of types, which structs can implement, though they aren't methods directly implemented on the struct itself, more on that in a moment though.\nJulia uses a system exclusively reliant on types and specialization. For anybody who has written R using S3 generics, the generic system in Julia should come quite naturally, if you're proficient with writing your own S3 generic methods. For those who have written C++ before, template specialization is a similar concept. Due to the lack of inheritance, which means no method overriding, specialization is often used. \nDue to the nature of specialization, ocassionally some sort of a code editor will be required to determine which method is being called, and from which package, and packages are free to specialize methods. \nEcosystem\nDifferential Equations\nFor modeling differential equations, the library DifferentialEquations.jl is stellar. A comparison to existing libraries can be seen below.\n\nUsing the differential equations package is a breeze and because Julia is compiled JIT using LLVM before executing, evaluating differential equations and situations like parameter fitting are much faster than their python counterparts with scipy. DifferentialEquations.jl contains many more solvers than Python, and the implementation of those solvers often is much faster than the Python based solutions in scipy. \nCertain uses of specialization allows for more consistent method calls when multiple differential equation systems are being used, likewise for multiple parameter sets. \nPlotting\nJulia has bindings to many plotting libraries, including an official one, Plots.jl. Plots.jl is not as fully featured as plotting libraries from other languages such as Plotly or ggplot, and I would argue that matplotlib also has more features. That said, the best description I can give for Plots.jl is that it feels like what matplotlib should have been. It just writes more concisely, the spacing works out rather well, and the theming appears reasonable by default. Julia also has bindings for plotly. However, that said, Pluto.jl (which I'll describe in detail later) does not support plotly and therefore is mostly limited (due to the ecosystem) to using the in built Julia Plots.jl library which is not as mature or featured as plotly.\nWhere Julia Falls Short\nMaturity\nJulia feels immature. I understand that it's a young language, and I will say the language documentation as well as many popular documentation is excellent, unified, and easy to navigate. \nTooling\nHowever, there are some major caveats. The Julia IDE support feels quite limited. Features such as function extraction, variable extraction, and inlining all were shaky, even when using the Julia recommended editor (VSCode) and extension.  I never had them produce anything wrong, just failed to activate in situations where they definitely could have been utilized. \nPackages\nA lot of the Julia packages are very fragmented, often it will be necessary to install multiple libraries (which Pluto luckily makes easy, every notebook is its own package manager). However, it's still slightly tedious to have to install a dataframes package as well as a csv package to read in said dataframe. In general it's much less ergnomic to write in this way. Also, package imports need to be compiled by your computer for your machine the first time they're included in a project, and the Julia compiler is quite slow so it does slow down the workflow quite a bit while the packages are installing.\nJupyter support.\nJulia supports Jupyter! This is excellent for easing the transition from Python. Just set the kernel to Julia and it's all plug and play. However, the implementation is not without it's issues. For instance, because Julia is compiled JIT, and jupyter kernels are quite limited. Redefining a struct instance is not possible. Once a struct is implemented and the code is ran, it is impossible to add or remove fields from that struct. Julia will simply not allow you to recompile that cell (unless you restart the kernel, requiring recomputing all variables). To me, this is a dealbreaker. Julia is a data science language. I should be able to edit my code after I write it. All is not lost however, there is an excellent library called Pluto.jl which has it's own idea for notebooks. They are a single Julia source code file that is rendered and edited using a live web interface, which does seem to do something, and from what I can tell it's a form of name mangling to support structs changing definition. Pluto variables must be present in the file to be usable, and updating a variable in the editor will require a full recompute of all references that depend on that variable. I find this excellent, because there have been a fair few times where my Python notebooks have broken or worse silently wrong because of a variable used that is no longer in the notebook, but still in memory. The downside of Pluto, of course, is that the community needs to maintain it, and while it has autocomplete and live documentation (which is amazing btw), it doesn't have all the export features which Python notebooks have.\nJulia Enjoyability\nIn my limited experience with Julia, it feels much better to write than python. The builtin support for decent indexing without need for libraries like numpy make it much more approachable. As does the fact that packages tend to integrate relatively well and styles across libraries appear relatively consistent. \nTo compare, at one point in history, I wrote a genetic algorithm in Python for parameter fitting differential equations which I re-implemented in Julia. Despite my lack of experience in Julia, my Julia implementation was done faster and ran faster, with what I would argue is feature parity. \nIn general, Julia feels quite imperative rather than functional. I would argue that it feels very similar to Python as far as that balance goes. I, personally, enjoy more functional languages, and there is libraries for method piping that do tend to work quite well and I make use of them when a good use case arises. \nJulia fixes a lot of things from python. Having a stable package manager that doesn't require virtual environments makes Julia much easier to approach and programs much easier to reproduce than Python with a much lower skill required to get writing. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cs/julia-for-circadian-modeling/","title":"Julia: Applications in Circadian Modeling"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/unity/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/unity/","title":"Table Of Contents"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/unity/unity-separation-and-communication/":{"body":"Background\nAs a bit of a disclaimer, I don't do a lot of game dev myself, and am mostly leaving this here as a guide to my future self so that I don't forget.\nWhat is decoupling? It is essentially the procedure of separating implementation from behavior. It is the process of abstraction. \nI could explain more, but let's dive into an example.\nLet's say that we have a game, where players and enemies have an Inventory and there's things on the ground that can be picked up.\nWe could of course, for every object that could be picked up, model a way for that object to be picked up individually, but this is tedious and sacrifices time without even the benefit of flexibility. \nSo let's do something else instead. \nLet's say that when our player collides with our pickable, they try to place it in their inventory. \nTo do this, let's think about what actions need to be performed. \nUnity already gives us OnCollideEnter, for free, so let's just use that and when we collide, we can see if there's a component that's pickable on the item. That's the basic premise, but how do we know that an object is pickable, without constraining how we write code at all. \nTo do this, we can write what's called an interface. An interface defines what behaviors/methods are required to be implemented for a class to fully satisfy a certain behavior.  A class can later implement interfaces (like class extension, but the methods must be implemented entirely not overridden).\ninterface IPickable { \n\t/**\n\t* Creates / shows the game object in the scene\n\t* \n\t* @param position the position to place the pickable\n\t* @returns a game object that could be picked up later\n\t*/\n\tGameObject drop(Vector3 position);\n\n\t/**\n\t * Hides / deletes the game object from the scene\n\t */\n\tvoid pickup();\n}\n\nNote the \"I\" in front of IPickable. This is just by convention, C# devs generally write the letter \"I\" in front of the name of any interface. That convention is adopted here.\nAs an example of away to fulfill this behavior, but not the only way, it would be possible to use a prefab and Instantiate prefabs places, removing them or hiding them when they are picked up, but the actual mechanism doesn't matter. \nNote that for most games, pickup probably shouldn't be void, but rather some other interface or base class (probably some extension of ScriptableObject), this provides a way to display them in the inventory. Brakey's has a great, relevant video on ScriptableObjects, that could probably contextualize this.\nDepending on our use case, our inventory class can essentially be a List&lt;IPickable?&gt; (prefilled with null where useful), or it can can be a List of whatever the pickup method returns. Either way could certainly work, and it just simply depends on implementation requirements.\nFor our player collision method, we'd want at least the following code:\nvoid OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) { \n\tvar pickable = TryGetComponent&lt;IPickable&gt;(collision.gameObject);\n\tif (pickable != null) {\n\t\tpickable.pickup();\n\t}\n}\n\nThat will pick up our component, however, you will probably want to do do some sort of 1. inventory.InsertPickable(pickable), or, 2. inventory.PickedUp(pickable.pickup()), depending on what the design requires. 2 will probably be used for most games moreso than 1.\nFor pickable, we could simply define a component for the most general case, with no special behaviors\nclass Pickable: MonoBehavior, IPickable { \n\t/**\n\t* Creates / shows the game object in the scene\n\t* \n\t* @param position the position to place the pickable\n\t* @returns a game object that could be picked up later\n\t*/\n\tGameObject drop(Vector3 position) { \n\t\t// instantiate a new prefab at vector3 position\n\t\tthis.transform.position = position;\n\t\tSetActive(true);\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Hides / deletes the game object from the scene\n\t */\n\tvoid pickup() { \n\t\tSetActive(false);\n\t}\n}\n\nNow we can add the Pickable to any prefab that we would like by dragging it and dropping it in the Unity Scene Editor, and that will make it so player could collect that prefab instance and also drop it. Hopefully that last sentence carries a little weight, because it means we can essentially just mark prefabs as pickable in the Unity Scene Editor, without any changes to the codebase. If we want special behavior for some other prefab, we don't need to special case it in here. We can write a new class, similar to this one, but change out the body of the methods with the behavior we want, and not have to change anything about the code, and that MonoBehavior could be dropped onto any prefab. The player collision code cares that our class implements IPickable not Pickable, so we aren't dependent on the last code block at all. Once you're comfortable with this style, you could easily write, without any if statements, other behaviors such as pickables that never run out, pickables that can be picked up 3 times, etc. Having all your changes be additive makes it easy for other programmers to come along, and implement a new pickable, they don't need to understand how you wrote your code, they just need to implement the interface.\nWhew! That was a heck of a background. We did gloss over a few aspects though, which are much harder, communication. Where did our inventory come from? How do we re-use the inventory code for enemies and players? How do we access it? What if Unity didn't provide us with something like OnCollisionEnter or TryGetComponent? What if we want a cutscene to play when we pick up a specific pickable? This was my biggest stumbling block in Unity: communication.\nWhy Communicate?\nWe can certainly just request the type of the object that we want as a serialized field in our classes and invoke methods on that. Why shouldn't we do that? \n\nSometimes it's okay, but most times, it isn't. However, if it's one simple thing that will probably not need to be changed, I wouldn't bother.\nLack of Flexibility. Let's say I start a game and I as a Player has a Dog instance in a serialize field and I can pet that dog for a slight happiness buff. Let's say later on, I want a cat instead, now it's time to refactor. I don't like refactoring, because it requires refactoring + whatever else I wanted to be doing.\nDoesn't fit all use cases: Let's say my player could freeze bullets midair. Let's say there was a lot of bullets in the game. Now my player needs to hold a List&lt;Bullet&gt; and update that list depending on what bullets are in the scene. Also I need to iterate over them, whenever I freeze time. This is a repetitive pattern and annoying to get right. Oh wait, I actually want to freeze plasma rays too!\nNo official support for interfaces. Everything will be constrained by some base class. A base class  Pettable is restrictive for the Dog example, because our Dog might also extend something like Mammal, and not all Mammals are Pettable, but we can't extend both Mammal and Pettable.\n\nOften times, other communication patterns simply fit better, and allow us to \"lift up\" more game design choices into Unity Scene Editor itself, where non-programmers can make changes\nSame Object Communication\nPerhaps the simplest form of communication, simply one component talking to other components on the same game object.\nWhile it is possible to implement most entity behaviors using simply one monobehavior, this is often inflexible, and can lead to classes that take a lot to understand because they implement a lot of distinct pieces of logic. There is a concept called the Single Responsibility Principle. Every class implemented would be preferably implemented to this standard, and when possible, it should be adhered to. \nSeparating out game logic into different components promotes re-use and makes reading code and implementing new features a little easier. To communicate between components, define interfaces between them for communication, that way, it's simple to change out one component for another.\nFor instance our main character entity could have \n\nPlayer\nInventory\n\nLet's say our player class facilites movement and picking things up. What we probably want for our inventory is an IPlayerInventory interface, which Inventory can implement. This allows us to substitute out our inventories if we should want to do something like that in the future. We can always request components by an interface they implement by calling GetComponent&lt;IPlayerInventory&gt;. Our IPlayerInventory should at least probably support adding and dropping pickables, as well as perhaps some way to request all the items in the inventory so we can display them required as methods.\nAs an example, we could have an an interface,\ninterface IPlayerInventory&lt;T&gt; { \n\tIEnumerable&lt;T&gt; RetrieveItems();\n\tvoid Pickup(T pickable);\n\tvoid Drop(T pickable);\n}\n\nNote that from the case discussed in the background IPickable is the type that satisfies T for an inventory containing pickables. \nNow in our Player:  MonoBehaviour\nclass Player: MonoBehaviour {\n\tprivate IPlayerInventory&lt;IPickable&gt; inventory;\n\tvoid Awake() { \n\t\tinventory = GetComponent&lt;IPlayerInventory&lt;IPickable&gt;&gt;();\n\t}\n\n\tvoid OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) { \n\t\tvar pickable = TryGetComponent&lt;IPickable&gt;(collision.gameObject);\n\t\tif (pickable != null) {\n\t\t\tpickable.pickup();\n\t\t\tinventory.Pickup(pickable);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nNote that in this case, we can clearly see that the player doesn't require a specific inventory, it just requires one that meets the bounds required above. We can then implement an inventory that adheres to the IPlayerInterface&lt;IPickable&gt;. This style of coding clearly establishes a separation of concerns. \nHopefully at this point, it is clear how we could swap out other implementations for inventory. \nNote that this subsection's description is often referred to as the Strategy pattern. \nPeer to Peer Driven Communication\nThe ability for one object to reflect the state of another object, such as a hotbar reflecting an inventory is often a necessary feature for games to implement. \nAs of right now, I would probably just have a hotbar component that receives an [SerializeField] private Inventory inventory instance and calls it's public methods directly, but if you know a good way to decouple these behaviors without using an external package, please PR!\nUpdate: 2023-2-2\nWhile I haven't tried this, given a little more thought about this use case, perhaps something like the Model View Controller would be most sufficient. \n\nThis is a well established pattern, so perhaps we can think about how we can apply it to Unity. Let's think about an Inventory reflected in a \"hotbar\" kind of scenario. The \"inventory\" is the Model in the model view controller. \nLet's think of the design for the hotbar. There could be a hotbar game object, which shows the user the hotbar, in model view controller this would be our View. An instance attached like InventoryHotbarViewUI is a possible name for one of the hotbar components. Then something like InventoryHotbarViewController could be attached to the original element and this could communicate to the Inventory (Model) through the same pattern as \"Same Object Communication\". The view accepts the controller directly, in that way, the components are tightly coupled, but I think that for most cases the view is intrinsically tied to the controller. However it makes sense that the controller shouldn't be intrinsically linked to the inventory (but should rather talk to it through the Strategy pattern as outlined in the \"Same Object Communication\" section).  The interface that the Inventory talks to the controllers through should capture the behavior of the inventory with the most lax type bounds possible. \nFor the full inventory edit menu (like something that takes up the whole screen), a similar treatment is applied. A View is applied to an external element and a controller is added as a component to the Inventory game object. Use the unity editor to supply the field on the view which takes the Controller instance by type directly. \nNote it is crucial that the inventory supplies objects by reference, not by value through it's implementing interface, so that the child components can just re-render that on every frame. This is slightly inefficient, but the alternative would be to wire up some \"peer-to-peer\" messaging that tells the objects when to poll for new value types. A large part benefit of this pattern comes from the fact that the inventory is the one source of truth, it and it alone manages the state, so there's nothing to sync up between game objects.\nThe benefits of this pattern, though slightly more boilerplate, is that it's possible to change implementations for the Inventory, but not break the views or editing logic of dependents. It is also possible to swap out multiple ways to work with the inventory without having to modify the inventory itself. \nOf course the downside is that we need to hand roll a new controller every time, but I have a feeling this pattern doesn't come up so often that it is a killer.\nMultiple-Producer, Multiple-Consumer Communication\nDefinitions\nI invented the terms \"restrictive\" and \"unrestrictive\" to describe modes of event sending where communication is limited to those who have an instance of a certain event channel (former), and event systems where just broad listening is possible \"unrestrictive\".\n\"peer\" here refers to \"GameObjects\".\nRestrictive Events\nThe essential premise is what I've heard other Unity devs online call the \"ScriptableObject Channel\", where scriptable object instances made in Unity are provided to Unity MonoBehaviours, and then messages are passed through the channel where listeners react to those events. \nThere are two kinds of these as well, lazy and sequential. Pull from queue to know what's available(lazy), and react to events the moment they happen(sequential). \nSo for instance, I could have an InventoryUpdateChannel called invChannel and I can say invChannel.publish(new InventoryUpdate(7, potatoes)). When \"potatoes\" are  in slot 7, and a listener can pick this up and can then update the hotbar.\nHere's how the approach breaks down, \n\nIn the GUI\n\nCreate instance of message channel scriptable object for any specific channel type\nPass instance to receiving MonoBehaviours\n\n\nIn the code\n\nReceive instance of channel (1 line)\nPublish events (1 line)\nSubscript events (1 line)\n\n\n\nThis is in contrast to method calling directly calling one peer method (1 line for method call + 1 line one serialize field or worse FindObjectOfType = 2 lines), or if many things need to be called, it will add an additional two lines, either every time, or inside a method (now 5 lines). The channel based approach is more flexible to use in the editor, is more flexible to implement, and is shorter than method calls directly, if there are multiple listeners, but does come at a slight performance hit.\nA simple way to do event based peer to peer messaging would be to follow an implementation like my own, RadioActive. It is sequential. It is possible to use as is, or as inspiration to write a different system. It keeps concerns separate across messaging channels and takes decent advantage of the C# type system.\nUnrestrictive Events\nSometimes, it's desirable be able to fire off, arbitrary events with perhaps a few instances associated with that, there is a package called MessageKit. I haven't used it myself, but for most things I would argue that it is a better fit than many other solutions posted here for simpler projects. For more complex projects, longer stories, more elements, etc, I have a feeling this package will feel quite limited and would recommend writing something using ScriptableObjects\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/unity/unity-separation-and-communication/","title":"Decoupling & Communication in Unity"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cs/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cs/julia-for-circadian-modeling/":{"body":665,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/unity/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/unity/unity-separation-and-communication/":{"body":1347,"title":3}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
